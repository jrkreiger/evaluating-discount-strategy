# Flatiron School Project 2
## Evaluating the Discount Strategy at Northwind Traders


### Description
This repository contains files from a project assigned to me as part of Flatiron School's Online Data Science Bootcamp. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate skills in hypothesis testing.

Here's what you'll find inside:
- **kreiger-project-2.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing project code
- **Northwind_ERD_updated.png** Schematic diagram (ERD) of the Northwind database
- **Northwind_small.sqlite**: Northwind database in sqlite format (created by Microsoft, provided by Flatiron School)
- **presentation.pdf**: PDF file containing slides from a non-technical presentation of project results
- **welch_functions.py**: Python script containing functions for performing a Welch's t-test

### Technical specifications
I created the Jupyter Notebook in a virtual environment provided to me by Flatiron School. Things may work a little differently for you if you're running different versions of Python or the packages I used.

If you download the notebook to view locally, note that I formatted it using Jupyter Notebook extensions (https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions). The extensions let me easily create a table of contents and collapse groups of cells to make the notebook easier to read and navigate. If you don't have the extensions installed locally, the notebook will look a little different for you.

### Authorship
Flatiron School provided me the database, the database schema diagram, and the code I used for Welch's t-test. I wrote the rest of the code in the Jupyter Notebook, the text of this README, my blog post linked above, and the content of my non-technical presentation.
